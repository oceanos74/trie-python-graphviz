In order to have the graphviz visualization part working, you need to follow the instructions as described here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz
Compiling the dot code from python requires the dot executable to be on systems' path.

You can compile the dot code also from the cmd/console, for example as:
dot -Tpdf -o output.pdf trie_dot.gv

Several customisations will result in a more advanced visualization. For example, a Trie can be represented growing radially. For that, add these changes to the dot code:

	layout=twopi
	fixedsize=true
	width=0.2
	height=0.2
	# the numbers in the ranksep represent the increment in radius for each rank
	ranksep="5 10 15 20 15 10 5 2 2 1 1 1 1 1"
	splines=line
	root=0

	node [shape=circle fixedsize=true width=0.25 height=0.25]
